				For example, once the records are on restricted access, you may legally answer
				"No" when a job, school, or occupational licensing application asks, "Have you
				ever been arrested for or convicted or adjudicated of a crime?" If you are unsure about how to answer, get advice.
				the law also permits you to see a court order to get access to your own juvenile records. Under certain circumstances,
				 you may also sign a release or seek a court order to allow other agencies and entities, including military personnel, to obtain your juvenile records.

				While juvenile records are generally confidential, there are certain exceptions that allow police,

				What is automatic restriction of access to records?
			</paragraph>
			<paragraph font="Arial-10" spacing-after="10">
				Texas has a system in place that restricts the access to juvenile records once a person turns 17 
				years of age.  This is in addition to your opportunity to have your records sealed or destroyed
				under other provisions in the Texas Family Code.  
			</paragraph>	
			<paragraph font="Arial-10">
				Under automatic restriction of access, the records are not destroyed or sealed; they still exist
				but can only be accessed by federal or state criminal justice agencies for a criminal justice
				purpose, such as investigation of a crime or screening applicants for employment with the criminal
				justice agency.  For anyone else who asks about the records, including employers, schools, and 
				licensing bodies, the entity in possession of the records is required to respond, &quot;No records
				exist for that person.&quot; Additionally, once your records have been restricted, you are allowed
				to &quot;legally deny&quot; your history and say you were never arrested, prosecuted, or adjudicated
				for an offense.

				What do I have to do to get access to my records restricted?
			</paragraph>
			<paragraph font="Arial-10" spacing-after="20">
				While getting records sealed or destroyed generally requires you to hire an attorney and file a request
				with the juvenile court, getting your records restricted does not require any action on your part.
				Prior to 2011, Records are automatically restricted when you turn 17. However, your records may be adjudications that occur after age 17.
				 If this happens, your delinquency history may once again become available to certain agencies and organizations that conduct background checks.
