    <td align="justify">Harris County�s current JIMS application is an integrated solution that serves as a key data source for Local, State and Federal agencies.  JIMS2 will further Harris County�s vision for an integrated justice information system and, as a result, improve taxpayer services.  The project goal is to further streamline justice activities by incorporating additional agency applications into the management system while providing extensive data sharing, data linkages and data reporting.  
The scope of the new system includes the re-design and development of the JIMS subsystems. </td>
