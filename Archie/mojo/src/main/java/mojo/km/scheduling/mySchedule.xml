<!-- 
    A sample  XML file that demonstrates
    Here are the busines rules for this sample:
    - This app needs to run every other day from the first date of notification   
    - This app can terminate the notification process.
    - This app do not run on new year, and on my birthdy, heheheh :)
        the new notificatin date is next day. except for 01/01/2004, the 
        next notification is 2 days after.
    - This app cannot run on the weekends. next notification should be on Monday
    
    This sample shows that we can re configure the scheduler using XML files
    without changing the code.
