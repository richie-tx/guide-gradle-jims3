/**
 * <p>Custom tag to perform case statement processing in conjunction
 * with the SwitchTag.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each nested CaseTag calls the SwitchTag to check
 * for a match. If a match is found the Body of the CaseTag is evaluated,
 * otherwise it is ignored.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>See the SwitchTag for an example of using this tag.</strong></p>
 * </br>
 *
 * <p>This tag is based the existing Struts logic tags and equivalent
 * processing can be achieved by setting the <strong>"op"</strong> value as follows:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> "Equal" - variable = value (equivalent to the EqualTag)</li>
 * <li> "NotEqual" - variable != value (equivalent to the NotEqualTag)</li>
 * <li> "LessThan" - variable < value (equivalent to the LessThanTag)</li>
 * <li> "LessEqual" - variable <= value (equivalent to the LessEqualTag)</li>
 * <li> "GreaterThan" - variable > value (equivalent to the GreaterThanTag)</li>
 * <li> "GreaterEqual" - variable >= value (equivalent to the GreaterEqualTag)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If the operator is not specified - "equal" is assumed.</p>
